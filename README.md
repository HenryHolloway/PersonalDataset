# Personal Dataset
Personal dataset project for DATA 115 at WSU

This project aims to explore the difference between deaths from COVID-19 and Influenza/Pneumonia. Data for 2020 COVID-19 deaths was obtained from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/download) and Influenza data was taken from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/flu_pneumonia_mortality/flu_pneumonia.htm). 


![Flu vs COVID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenryHolloway/PersonalDataset/main/FLUvsCOVID.png)
This is a simple visualization comparing the deaths in each state from Influenza/Pneumonia against deaths from COVID-19. The measures put into place to protect against the novel coronavirus would also protect against the flu virus, so for an accurate comparison I took the average of Influenza/Pneumonia deaths each year from 2014-2019 and compared that with all COVID-19 deaths in each state in 2020.
